Here’s a line-by-line walkthrough of `1.asm` (written for the MIPS/SPIM simulator):

1. `.data`  
   – Marks the beginning of the data segment, where static variables and constants are stored.

2. `str: .asciiz "Hello World"`  
   – Defines a label `str` that points to a NUL-terminated ASCII string (“Hello World”).  
   – `.asciiz` automatically appends the terminating byte `0x00`.

3. `.text`  
   – Marks the beginning of the text segment, i.e., where instructions (code) live.

4. `main:`  
   – A label identifying the program’s entry point (what SPIM calls when it starts).

5. `la $a0, str`  
   – `la` (“load address”) loads the address of `str` into register `$a0`.  
   – By convention, `$a0 – $a3` are used to pass the first four arguments to a system call or function; here `$a0` will hold the pointer to the string we want to print.

6. `li $v0, 4`  
   – `li` (“load immediate”) sets `$v0` to `4`.  
   – In SPIM’s syscall convention, `$v0` specifies the service number.  
   – Service 4 = “print string”.

7. `syscall`  
   – Invokes the kernel service indicated by `$v0`. Because `$v0 = 4`, the kernel prints the NUL-terminated string whose address is in `$a0` (“Hello World”) to the console.

8. (blank line – purely for readability)

9. `li $v0, 10`  
   – Loads `$v0` with `10`, the service number for “exit”.

10. `syscall`  
    – Called with `$v0 = 10`, the kernel terminates the program and returns control to the operating system (or ends simulation in SPIM).

11. (trailing blank line)

Key takeaways:

• The program has only two syscalls:  
  – `4` → print string (needs `$a0` = address of NUL-terminated string).  
  – `10` → exit (no arguments).  

• All work happens via the syscall interface; there are no explicit loops or registers modified beyond `$a0` and `$v0`.

• Registers used:
  – `$a0`: argument 0 (pointer to string).  
  – `$v0`: syscall selector (and sometimes return value).

So the entire program’s control flow is:

1. Load address of `str` into `$a0`.  
2. Set `$v0 = 4`; syscall → prints “Hello World”.  
3. Set `$v0 = 10`; syscall → exit.
